Nitinol Design Concepts
=======================

Nitinol Devices and Components was founded in 1991, and has always been a leader in design, development, and commercialization of nitinol materials, components, and medical devices. Now as part of [Confluent Medical Technologies](https://confluentmedical.com), we have expanded to include medical balloons, catheters, precision polymers, textiles, and world class manufacturing capabilities. Science, publication, outreach, and education have always been a priority for us, and you can find many of our papers at the [nitinol.com](https://nitinol.com) reference library. Nitinol Design Concepts is an open-source, creative-commons spin on that tradition. Each topic in this series includes a tech-brief style article, as indexed below. All of the related design files, results, code, and data can be found in the [nitinol-design-concepts](https://github.com/cbonsig/nitinol-design-concepts) GitHub repository. 

GitHub is a collaboration platform that is widely used for software development. You don't need to know how it works to read or use the content here - just click on the links below! If you have input or suggestions, please create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to let us know. And if you're feeling ambitious, you can learn more about how to edit or contribute content at [GitHub's training site](https://services.github.com/on-demand/). Some great starting places are [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and [Forking a Project](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

The content here includes a deeper dive into topic covered in our Nitinol University courses, as well as research supporting scientific presentation and publications. [The Basics](#the-basics) provides an introduction to design and simulation of a nitinol component, following methods that are commonly applied in the medical device industry. [Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) ventures into some more speculative territory, including new and emerging approaches that we find interesting. 


## The Basics

This first series follows each step in the design and analysis of a realistic (but non-proprietary) laser cut nitinol component, from designing the geometry using Solidworks to shape setting and fatigue cycling using Abaqus.

* [NDC-105: Design](105-open-frame-design) \| Create a 3D model of a laser cut Open Frame component using Solidworks.
* [NDC-110: Mechanical Properties](110-material-characterization) \| Perform tensile testing to characterize mechanical properties for simulation.
* [NDC-115: Shape Setting](115-open-frame-shape-set) \| Expand the laser cut component into a complex expanded shape using Abaqus finite element analysis.
* [NDC-120: Fatigue Simulation](120-open-frame-fatigue) \| Apply fatigue loading conditions using Abaqus.
* NDC-125: Fatigue Point Cloud, manual and scripted

## Advanced Topics

* [NDC-205: Advancing Nitinol Fatigue Prediction](205-advancing-fatigue-prediction) \| A review of present and future approaches to lifetime prediction of superelastic nitinol.
* [NDC-210: Volumetric characterization of inclusions from submicron CT scans](210-xct-methods) \| submicron xray tomography: methods and results
* advanced scripting and volume weighted simulation results
* probabilistic durability prediction using monte-carlo methods
